```

### 4. Configure API Keys & Environment Variables
You can simply edit the code by pasting your apikey for udemy api, gemini api, and rapidapi key for jsearch api and replace them approriately in the place of "your_api_key", instead of following the below step.

if you are the following below step make change necessary changes in your code.
Create a `.env` file in your project’s root directory:
```bash
touch .env  # (type in cmd or terminal)
```
Inside `.env`, add your private keys and configuration:
```ini
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_key
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
```
 **Alternative:**  
If you prefer, you can create a sample config file:  
`instance/config.py.example`  
And write:

```python
FLASK_APP = "app.py"
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_google_gemini_key"
RAPIDAPI_KEY = "your_rapidapi_key"
```
